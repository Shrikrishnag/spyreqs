=====================

The spyreqs library exposes to the window the spyreqs object which has three properties:<br>

1.The rest property which is an object that contains rest methods<br>
2.The jsom property which is an object that contains jsom methods<br>
3.The utils property which is an object that contains general purpose methods<br>
<br>

Both spyreqs.rest and spyreqs.jsom contains methods that refers either to the <br>
Application scope or to the Host Site scope. If the method is for use in the App scope <br>
then it contains 'App' in its name otherwise it contains 'Host'. Because use, arguments and <br>
reults of both app methods and host methods are identical for each case there will be <br>
documentation for one of them<br>
